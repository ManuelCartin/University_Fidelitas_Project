# University_Fidelitas_Project
This repository contains a collection of academic projects developed during my studies on behalf of your program/university. The main objective is to document my progress, apply the knowledge I've acquired, and showcase the technical skills I've developed throughout my education.

# Repository Structure ðŸ“‚
Each project is organized in its own folder, named clearly and concisely. Within each folder, you'll find the project files, along with an individual README.md file that provides specific details about that project.
