# Data Science Introduction
The objective of these projects was to apply the theoretical foundations of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to real-world problems.
# Case Study
Each case study has a different purpose and introduces us as students to the introductory coursework, applying a foundation of Python and libraries for subsequent courses.
# Tools and Libraries Used üõ†Ô∏è
These projects allowed me to gain practical experience with the following key tools and libraries in the data science ecosystem:
- Languages: Python
- Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-lear
- Development Environments: Google Colab
